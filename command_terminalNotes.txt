#general commands for navigating unix:

man [command] = manual for a command

ls = list (use 'ls -p' to see directories)touch
pwd = print directory window
cd = change directory
mv (thing) [directory] = moves a thing into a directory
cp (thing) [directory] = copies a thing into a directory

nano = nano editor, lets you create scripts and save them

chmod u+x [script] = allows you to run a script/executable, as normally they require permission

grep {-v} "search" [file] | less = 'grab' a search of a file in text, with '| less' linking the command to spit out a text output
--modifiers: 
-v = exclude search rather than include
-i = ignore case when searching
-c = count lines with matching search, output of a number

#regular expressions
. = empty space, can be anything
* = match zero or more of the preceeding character, i.e. "include any number of this thing in the search too" or a "wildcard"
^ = line must start with following sequence
$ = line must end with preceeding sequence

tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' = transliterate (change case) of range of letters
sed 's/something/somethingElse' = changes the way something prints out, turns something into somethingElse
wc {-l} [file] = prints out 'num1 num2 num3' which correspond to the lines, words, and bytes in the file. use -l to show only line count

Use ./ to indicate current directory and ../ to go back a directory



#fastqc: 
useful website: https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-salmon-flipped/lessons/05_qc_running_fastqc_interactively.html

# this line runs fastqc on every *.gz file in the directory, using 3 threads, and outputs it into the current directory
$ fastqc -o ./ -t 3 ../../../dmel/speciesRNAseq/fastq/melanogaster_LechetaEtAl/*.gz

#star indexing:
#star command for mapping the latest melanogaster genome
$ STAR --runMode genomeGenerate \	#dictates to run the genome indexing
--runThreadN 4 \	#uses 4 threads
--genomeDir /scratch/alpine/grra3428/dbipecGenome/STARdmelGenome \	#designates output directory
--genomeFastaFiles /scratch/alpine/grra3428/dbipecGenome/GCF_018153845.1_ASM1815384v1_genomic.fna \	#designates directory where genome fasta file
--sjdbGTFfile /scratch/alpine/grra3428/dbipecGenome/GCF_018153845.1_ASM1815384v1_genomic.gtf \  	#designates annotation gtf file
--sjdbOverhang 99 \	#setting to indicate the length of reads, in this case all reads were 100bp in length, so used 99
--genomeSAindexNbases 12	#something(?) but useful for drosophilid genomes


#star mapping:
#star command for running the Lecheta data. run it while in the tristanb/starMapped directory
$ STAR --runThreadN 4	#uses 4 threads
--genomeDir ../star	#uses indexed genome from the ../star directory
--readFilesCommand zcat ../../../dmel/speciesRNAseq/fastq/melanogaster_LechetaEtAl/SRR11300812.fastq.gz	#reads zipped files using the zcat command while reading from the file location
--outFileNamePrefix sample2/prefix	#puts a prefix on the output while depositing it into the directory "sample 2"
--outSAMtype BAM Unsorted	#output file type
--quantMode GeneCounts	#output file type
--outFilterMultimapScoreRange 0
--outFilterMultimapNmax 1
