# reAnalysis-of-LechetaEtAl
This is a small repository acting as a lab notebook during my introduction to RNA-Seq .fastq analysis

[MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) was used on Windows to access a remote server. I can definitely recommend this, it was quite intuitive once I got past the learning curve.

Links I've found useful while learning:

[Intro to Unix and navigation in the command terminal](http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/Unix_and_Perl/current.html)

[Regular expressions for terminal](https://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html)

[FastQ file format info](https://learn.gencore.bio.nyu.edu/ngs-file-formats/fastq-format/)

[FastQC and FastQ format](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-salmon-flipped/lessons/05_qc_running_fastqc_interactively.html)

[STAR software manual](https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/skrabanek/lab/angsd/lecture_notes/STARmanual.pdf)

In the repository, there is a command_terminalNotes.txt file that has my notes while I was learning, as well as some commands (with explanations) used for FastQC analysis and STAR indexing and mapping.
There is also a .r file which served as the beginning of differential expression analysis, though not much has been done with it at this point. 
There are also the .html files from FastQC analysis.
